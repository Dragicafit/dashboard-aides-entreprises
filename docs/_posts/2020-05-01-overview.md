## INTRODUCTION

ODAMAP is designed to help you visualize datasets - and particularly geocoded datasets - in an [interactive dashboard](https://aides-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/).

The French government has a strong policy towards open data, so citizen could access more easily to data produced by every branch of the state or local governments. This policy is coordinated by the [Etalab mission](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/qui-sommes-nous)

Most of datasets opened by the state, by local governments, and by some members of the civil society are nowadays published on [data.gouv.fr](https://data.gouv.fr/).

During the 2020 covid-19 crisis ODAMAP was developped in an emergency as part of the government's will to communicate on public efforts .

More on the history of development of ODAMAP [following this link]({{site.base_url}}/history).

To help citizen and administrations to highlight and navigate some datasets, or groups of datasets relative to a common topic, we developped ODAMAP. This 100% open source project basically propose some veery common and basic features any other dattavisualisation website / service could propose : interactive maps, interactive charts, custom texts, custom colors...

## ODAMAP'S MAIN FEATURES 

ODAMAP includes "out-the-box" a website generator to create an original datavisualisation website from scratch and without backend.

ODAMAP main features are the following :

- "single-page app" (SPA) developped with Vue.js/Nuxt.js) ;
- map views (with Mapbox-GL) ;
- chart views (with) ApexCharts ;
- mobile responsive ;
- designed to be integrated in iframes ;
- ability to load external text/html contents ;
- routable urls (routes and url parameters) ;
- can display several datasets (locally from statics or distant) ;
- internationalization (with i18n);
- fully customizable ;

## CUSTOMIZATION

### Configuration files

ODAMAP aims to be fully customizable, but also to still remain simple enough to be reused by a community of developpers. This customizabilization relies (for the moment) on several configuration files you'll need to familiarize with.

More on that topic [on this page]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration/config-overview)
